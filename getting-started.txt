Proposed data source: NFL data instead of eSports because:
  -Many more years of data available
  -Many more data points available
  -More common / popular
  -eSports has more violent terminology (especially CSGO)

Brainstorming features:
  -Main page with "top 10" lists (ex: QBs, RBs, Receivers, LBs, etc.) at top
  -Below that, team logos and names displayed as grid
    -Click on logo -> go to team page
    -Team pages highlight top players, roster, etc.
  -Data obtained using scraping or API, TBD
  -Simple text database: stats per team per year
    -Per team: individual player stats
      -Special case: players being traded during season and having stats for more than one team
  -Down the road: pretty visualizations for things like a team's yards per season, TDs per season, yards against, tackles, etc.

Implementation:
  -Noah's guidance -> TBD
    -Front end langs/tools?
    -Back end langs/tools?
    -Scraping/getting data?

My desired tasks:
  1. Database
  2. Scraping/getting data
  3. ???
  4. Interested in front end but very little experience
